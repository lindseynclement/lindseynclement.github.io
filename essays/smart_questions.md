# Introduction 
  In the software engineering world, asking questions is a necessary task for developers. However, many do not understand how to ask a smart question. Eric Steven Raymond, in his piece *How to Ask Questions the Smart Way*, outlines that a smart question indicates that the individual has made an effort to attempt to solve the problem on their own before asking, respects the time of the community, and understands the context to which their question belongs. Asking a smart question is an essential skill that software engineers must master, one that separates effective developers from those who struggle to find solutions. On platforms like Stack Overflow, where experienced developers share their time and knowledge, asking smart questions is a crucial practice. In this piece, two questions asked on Stack Overflow will be examined through the lens of Raymond’s ideas on what constitutes a “smart question”. 

# The Smart Question: Undoing Commits in Git:
  The [first question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/927358/how-do-i-undo-the-most-recent-local-commits-in-git) asks, “I accidentally committed the wrong files to Git, but didn’t push the commit to the server yet. How do I undo those commits from the local repository?”.  

## Clarity of the Question
   The asker clearly describes the problem, committing the wrong files locally in Git, and wants to understand how to undo the commits. The wording is simple, concise, and leaves no room for misinterpretation. Raymond states in his article, *“Be precise and informative about your problem”*, which is a criteria met by this question. 

## Context
   The individual asking the question provides relevant context by stating that the commit has not been pushed yet, which is crucial information for narrowing down the scope of potential solutions. It also assists the reader in further understanding the question so they are able to better answer it. This aligns with the advice from Raymond, *“Describe the problem’s symptoms, not your guesses”*, indicating that the asker should focus on the actual issue rather than speculations. 

 ## No Assumptions 
  In the article, one of Raymond’s principles for asking a smart question is to, *“Describe the goal, not the step”*. This advice pushes for the question to focus on what the asker is trying to get across rather than presenting any assumptions on the issue. In this smart question asked on Stack Overflow, the user doesn’t offer guesses about the solution, but instead asks an open-ended yet specific question. This gives the viewers the flexibility to provide the correct approach without being limited by any assumptions implied from the asker. 

## Respect for the Community’s Time
  This question reflects a quality example of the asker respecting the community’s time by presenting a question that is both direct and informative. The individual focuses on the problem without any unnecessary details or background stories that could distract from the core issue. As Raymond puts, *“Prepare your question. Think it through”*, as well as *“Take your time”*- statements that emphasize being thoughtful and intentional when asking a question to receive a quality response. 

## Why This Question is Smart
   This question follows the principles outlined in *How to Ask Questions the Smart Way*. It demonstrates that the asker has already isolated their problem, and is now looking for the best method to resolve the issue. The question is likely to relieve a direct and quality response since it is easy to interpret and effectively engages with the Stack Overflow community. 

## Smart Responses
   The responses to this question on Stack Overflow are equally smart because the clear and concise question invited equally straightforward answers. The top answer on the post suggests using *git reset* to undo the last commit while preserving the changes in the working directory. This answer matches the clarity and directness of the question and provides a helpful solution to the problem. The responses reflect the smartness of the question itself due to its specific and relevant context.
