# Introduction 
  In the software engineering world, asking questions is a necessary task for developers. However, many do not understand how to ask a smart question. Eric Steven Raymond, in his piece *How to Ask Questions the Smart Way*, outlines that a smart question indicates that the individual has made an effort to attempt to solve the problem on their own before asking, respects the time of the community, and understands the context to which their question belongs. Asking a smart question is an essential skill that software engineers must master, one that separates effective developers from those who struggle to find solutions. On platforms like Stack Overflow, where experienced developers share their time and knowledge, asking smart questions is a crucial practice. In this piece, two questions asked on Stack Overflow will be examined through the lens of Raymond’s ideas on what constitutes a “smart question”.
