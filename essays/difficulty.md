*Difficulty: a thing that is hard to accomplish, deal with, or understand.*

In the ever-evolving world of technology, the blend of creativity and technical proficiency forms the foundation of success. As I am navigating through the journey of being a computer science major at UH MƒÅnoa, I have developed a variety of interests such as front-end development, as well as full-stack development. These interests have evolved into skills that enhance my proficiency and prepare me to thrive to enter the workforce. 


## Crafting Code and Cracking Security: My Goals in Software Engineering & Beyond

My current interests in software engineering span over a range of fields, each interesting me in a unique way. At the forefront are mobile and front-end development, which allow me to showcase my creativity within the interactive and user-friendly interfaces that I create. 

Beyond software engineering, the realm of cybersecurity also interests me, as it involves protecting vital company assets through ethical hacking and security measures- both of which are critical and constantly evolving in our digital world. As a puzzle lover, cybersecurity intrigues me because it involves solving a variety of complex problems that require an eye for detail and understanding of digital systems. 

Full stack development is also something that appeals to me, offering the best of both worlds by allowing me to develop both client and server software. I have begun exploring these interests by engaging in a variety of activities such as working alongside a digital artist friend to build an iOS app and joining the Grey Hats cybersecurity club at my school. These experiences not only encourage my creative capabilities, but also ignite a deeper passion for exploring my software development interests further. 


## Mastering Tech: Building Hard and Soft Skills in Software Engineering

Ever hear people ragging on engineering companies for delivering late and way over budget? Well, some engineering jobs are really difficult, especially if the requirements and funding are undulating underneath you. Because of the nature of the problem, sometimes engineering firms require large amounts of engineers and workers, inviting further problems and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project at home has become this sort of poster child of failure, budget overrun and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Well, working though regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems like it's a mind bogglingly difficult job to do. Granted, there might be some fishy stuff going on, but I refuse to believe that everyone is involved for nefarious reasons.

The problem of creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is difficult! I'm not sure we would have done it right, even if the best people were involved.

## In the context of relationships

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
